Why You Need Multi-Modal Incident Management Software
========
Today’s IT monitoring systems enable you to track just about anything – from file sizes to network bandwidth to website traffic to potential viruses and other types of cyberattacks. There are all-inclusive tools that will do all of the above. Or, you can pick and choose the best tool for each of your monitoring needs. Regardless of which option you select, you can rest easy knowing that all of your IT systems are being monitored 24/7.

However, it is important to note that not all IT monitoring systems are designed to “solve” IT problems. Most IT monitoring systems instead help you identify IT problems and alert incident management team members about these issues. This means your incident management team likely plays a key role in resolving IT issues and preventing them from causing downtime and outages.

Incident management teams are important contributors to their respective organizations. Yet incident management team members rarely, if ever, get the support they need to perform their everyday tasks to the best of their ability. For example, IT professionals sometimes struggle to maintain the right work-life balance. And when an IT incident occurs, an IT professional may be notified about this incident at home, school or elsewhere. As such, an IT professional cannot relax; conversely, he or she must be ready to respond to a critical incident at a moment’s notice.

Today, being on-call involves much more than simply receiving emails. IT professionals need to be able to acknowledge issues, take assignments, jump on a conference bridge, create new tickets in ticketing software and much more. That’s where an incident management system with multi-modal communications can help IT professionals achieve the best-possible results.

AlertOps is both multi-modal and multilingual. It enables you to use different devices to access your data (like a laptop, smartphone or tablet) and receive messages in different formats (like email, voice call and SMS). It even empowers you to set up a “chat” conversation within a large team using collaboration tools like Slack or HipChat. This provides IT professionals with unparalleled flexibility, as they now can be fully functional from any location and on any device.

When it comes to simplifying, accelerating and improving incident management, it helps to choose tools that are both multi-modal and multilingual. Whereas some incident management tools offer a mobile app and access to email, no one brings together different devices and modes of communication like AlertOps. Thanks to AlertOps, IT professionals can ensure the right incident management team members consistently will receive the right alerts through the right platforms, leading to faster, more efficient results.
